 As experienced exporters, we've weathered many challenges in international trade — but our recent experience with Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) was alarming. Due to an unavoidable delay on the consignee's side, the release of the Bill of Lading (B/L) was held up. Instead of support, HMM imposed excessively high late B/L charges — fees that felt more like profit-driven penalties than fair costs. Despite our long-standing relationship and clean documentation, HMM refused any flexibility. Their stance highlights a broader issue: exporters often bear the cost of delays beyond their control, with no recourse. HMM has reportedly increased late B/L charges by 600% annually, an exploitative trend that needs to be challenged. This blog calls for greater accountability, transparency, and collective action within the shipping industry. It’s time exporters spoke out.
